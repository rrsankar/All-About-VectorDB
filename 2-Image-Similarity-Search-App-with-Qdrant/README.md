## What is a Vector Database?

A Vector Database is a new type of database designed to store and query high-dimensional data representation derived from ML models like Neural Networks.

These data representations are often called Vectors or Embeddings, and they are used to train ML models for different tasks like Sentiment Analysis & Object Detection.

Vector databases are optimized for storing and querying these high-dimensional vectors efficiently, and they often use specialized data structures and indexing techniques such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) â€“ which is used to implement Approximate Nearest Neighbors.

These databases enable fast similarity and semantic search while allowing users to find vectors that are the closest to a given query vector, based on some distance metric. 

The most commonly used distance metrics are Euclidean Distance, Cosine Similarity, & Dot Product.

Vector databases have gained popularity for its applications in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Semantic Search & Recommendation Systems.
