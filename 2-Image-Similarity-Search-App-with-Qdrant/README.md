# Image Similarity Search Application with Qdrant  

## What is a Vector Database?  

A Vector Database is a new type of database designed to store and query high-dimensional data representation derived from ML models like Neural Networks.

These data representations are often called Vectors or Embeddings, and they are used to train ML models for different tasks like Sentiment Analysis & Object Detection.

Vector databases are optimized for storing and querying these high-dimensional vectors efficiently, and they often use specialized data structures and indexing techniques such as Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) â€“ which is used to implement Approximate Nearest Neighbors.

Qdrant uses a custom version of HNSW, **filterable HNSW** with support for payload based filter.

These databases enable fast similarity and semantic search while allowing users to find vectors that are the closest to a given query vector, based on some distance metric. 

The most commonly used distance metrics are Euclidean Distance, Cosine Similarity, & Dot Product.

Vector databases have gained popularity for its applications in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Semantic Search & Recommendation Systems.

## Why do you need Vector Databases?  

Vector databases are essential in applications needing similarity search, like LLMs, Recommendation Systems, Content-Based Image Retrieval, and Personalized Search. 

They leverage efficient indexing and searching methods to swiftly and accurately retrieve unstructured data represented as vectors. 

This capability ensures users receive the most relevant results promptly.

## About Qdrant  

Qdrant is a **Vector Similarity Search Engine**, aka **VectorDB**.

Its Open-Source (Apache 2.0) & written in **Rust**.

Can use the cloud offering or the docker version in local with memmap/in-memory storage.

## Vector Payload  

In Qdrant, you can attach additional data to the vector.

A point (vector) has an id, vector & payload.

**Payload** is a **JSON object** that stores additional data related to the vector. E.g. text keyword, numeric, geo-coordinates etc.

You can use Payload to filter vectors during a query.

## Qdrant Architecture  

![qdrant-arch-highlevel](./assets/img/qdrant-arch-highlevel.png)

On a high-level, these are the main components in Qdrant.

Collections are a named set of points (vectors) among which you can search.

The vector of each point within the same collection must have the same dimensionality and be compared by a single metric.

Distance Metrics are used to measure similarities among vectors and must be selected when you create the collection. 

The choice of metric depends on the encoder used.

Points are the central entity in Qdrant, and they consist of a **vector**, an **id** & a **payload**.

An **id** a unique identifier for your **vector**.

A **Vector** is a high-dimensional representation of data, for example, an image, a sound, a document, a video, etc.

A **Payload** is a JSON object with additional data you can add to a vector.

In local, Qdrant can use one of two options for storage, In-memory storage (in RAM) or Memmap storage (in disk).

Alternatively, you can have the service running in Qdrant cloud and access it via API.

## About the Project

**Goal:** Find similar images stored in a VectorDB based on an input image.

**Encoder: ResNet50**

All the images stored in the collection are encoded using the same neural network (here, ResNet50).

The [notebook](https://github.com/rrsankar/All-About-VectorDB/blob/main/2-Image-Similarity-Search-App-with-Qdrant/get_embeddings/store_embeddings.ipynb) inside "get_embeddings" folder will convert the images and store it in Qdrant cluster in cloud. 

Check the notebook to see how it works.

*Note: Detailed explanation about the architecture & working of ResNet50 will be uploaded to a different repo.*  
*Link will be updated as soon as it is live.*

**VectorDB: Qdrant**

In this project, I used the Free-tier cloud version of Qdrant and not the docker version in local.

*Note: Detailed explanation about Vector databases & Qdrant are provided above and also through out this repo in different experiments.*

**App: Streamlit**

In this project, I used Streamlit to create a simple Web Application to demonstrate how Image Similarity Search work with Qdrant.

In the homepage of the web application, you would see 12 sample images to select an input image from.

![app-home](./assets/img/app-home.png)  

When you select an input image, it will find 12 similar images in Qdrant collection and display them.

## Conclusion

This is an experiment on Image Similarity using Qdrant Vector search engine.

This is a groundwork for the upcoming VectorDB, Image vectors, Generative AI & RAG project.

Stay tuned.
