This means there's a good chance you already know how to play Catan - but there's never a bad time to brush up on the official Catan rules to make sure you're playing correctly. Here you'll be able to do exactly that.\\nKlaus Teuber’s game of trading and expansion is considered one of the most influential and important board games of all time, sparking a golden age of modern tabletop gaming and shifting more than 20 million copies in the 30-plus years since it was first released. It seems everyone from Frozen star Kristen Bell to pop singer Carly Rae Jepsen is a fan.\\nWhile there have been plenty of expansions and spin-offs released for Catan over the years - there’s even a big-screen movie in the works - there are still plenty of people who have never played this classic game.\\nIf you’re yet to experience the legendary board game or simply need a refresher of the basic rules, read on and allow us to teach you how to play Catan.\\nHow many people can play Catan?\\nCatan can be played by two to four players. In the board game, the players compete to gather resources and build the biggest settlements on the fictional island of Catan.\\nHow long does Catan take to play?\\nCatan takes approximately one hour to play, but can take more or less time depending on the number of players, how familiar they are with the rules and what you roll!\\nHow to set up the board in Catan\\nThe board in Catan is modular, meaning it can be setup in a number of different variations. The more you play, the more creative you can get with how you put it together and the arrangement of starting tiles and tokens.\\nFor your first game of Catan, of if you're playing with beginners, there is a recommended way to set up the board. (Which you’ll see right at the beginning of the Catan rulebook.)\\nHere are the basic steps to set up the board in Catan:\\nAssemble the frame by clipping together the blue edges of the board.\\nArrange the land hex tiles in the beginner formation given in the rulebook, or shuffle them facedown and place them randomly for a variable setup.\\nPlace the numbered circle makers in either the beginner setup given or in alphabetical order, starting at a corner and working counter-clockwise toward the middle of the board.\\nThe robber pawn starts in the desert.\\nCatan player setup\\nEach player should choose a colour. Take the five settlements, four cities and 15 road pieces in that colour and place them in front of you.\\nPlace two settlements and two roads on the board. If you're using the recommended beginner setup, follow the layout in the rulebook. The experienced player rules instead allow each player to take it in turns to place a settlement and one adjacent road, with the order of placing reversed (so the last player goes first) to place a second settlement and adjacent road.\\nEach player should be given a building cost card - this will remind you what resources you’ll need to build further settlements, roads and cities, as well as buying development cards.\\nThe Longest Road and Largest Army cards, as well as the two dice, should be placed alongside the game board.\\nSeparate the resources into piles of their type: sheep, wood, brick, ore and wheat.\\nFor the recommended beginner setup, you take the resources of the land surrounding the settlement marked by the white star in the rulebook: Yellow receives a sheep, a wood and a wheat. Red gets a wheat, a wood and a sheep. Blue gets a brick, a sheep and an ore. White gets an ore, a wood and a sheep.\\nWhen using the experienced player setup, you instead receive resources from each of the tiles next to your second settlement.\\nCatan rules\\nIn Catan, each player turn is split into three phases:\\nResource production\\nTrading\\nBuilding\\n1. Resource production\\nBefore you do anything else on your turn, you must roll the two dice. The result applies to everyone and usually means you get to take a resource from the resource stacks depending on the number you’ve rolled and where your settlements are based. For example, Red rolls a 9, which means they receive a sheep this turn as their settlement sits on the corner of a field hex with a 9 marker that produces sheep. White is on the other side of that same hex and will also receive a sheep. There is another 9 at the top of the board, too; Yellow sits on that hex and receives a wheat.\\nEvery player needs to make sure they keep track of their own settlements and whether or not they receive a resource on any given roll.\\nCatan is a game of probability to a certain extent, as the resources that come up will be determined by the dice that get rolled. 7 is the most likely number to be rolled with two dice and is treated slightly differently, as it activates the Robber.\\nHow does the robber work in Catan?\\nIf you roll a 7 on your turn in Catan, you activate the robber.\\nAny player that has more than seven resource cards in their hand must return half of them (rounded down) to the resource stacks. That includes the person who activated the robber.\\nYou now get to move the robber onto one of the number tokens on the board. Players cannot gain resources from settlements adjacent to the covered tile if that number is rolled. The lasts until the robber is moved again and uncovers the number.\\nAs they are a robber, you also get to steal a resource at random from a player with a settlement next to the number you cover. If the robber affects more than one player, choose one to take a resource from.\\n2. Trade\\nThere are two types of trading in Catan: domestic and maritime.\\nDomestic trading is just a fancy way of saying you can trade with your fellow players. You can announce what you’re after and what you’d be willing to trade for it. Your fellow players can make counter offers and proposals to you (but not to each other!)\\nMaritime trading doesn’t involve the other players and can be incredibly useful when your opponents are being particularly stubborn about trading.\\nMaritime trading allows you to trade four of one good for one of another. You can perform this action this no matter what, but if you have a settlement or city on a harbour around the edge of the island, you get a rebate of some kind based on the token - such as being able to trade at 3:1 or sometimes even 2:1 for a specific resource.\\n3. Building\\nThe last part of each player’s turn is the building phase. This is when you are able to build roads, settlements and cities using your collected resources, as well as buying useful development cards.\\nYou can build any number of things on your turn as long as you have the resources available and the required building materials in your pool.\\nRoads\\nBuilding roads in Catan costs one brick and one wood. Roads are placed along the edges of hexes and will allow you to build settlements further afield, providing you with the opportunity to gain more resources.\\nThe first player to build a road at least five sections long (in a single stretch - not including forks) receives the Longest Road card, which is worth two victory points at the end of the game.\\nIf another player exceeds the length of that person’s road, they get to take that card from them - so the Longest Road card is never entirely safe in any one player’s possession.\\nSettlements\\nBuilding settlements in Catan costs one brick, one wood, one sheep and one wheat. Getting settlements on the board quickly can be quite an important strategy in the game, as each settlement is worth one victory point. You need 10 victory points to win the game.\\nYou can only place a settlement somewhere that is connected by your roads and you need to be at least two spaces away from another settlement, including your own. That means no settlement can be adjacent to another settlement.\\nAs well as giving you a precious victory point, each settlement rewards you with resources whenever one of the numbers next to it is rolled.\\nCities\\nBuilding cities in Catan costs three ore and two wheat, plus an existing settlement. A city in Catan is like a hotel in Monopoly, as it upgrades your settlement by replacing it.\\nYou can only build a city if you have a settlement on the board that can be replaced with the new city. Cities will earn you double the resources and are worth two victory points each.\\nCatan development cards explained\\nBuying development cards in Catan is also part of the building phase and costs one sheep, one ore and one wheat. It’s a bit of a lucky dip as you are buying blindly from the shuffled deck of cards but they are all beneficial to you.\\nDevelopment cards are kept hidden from your opponents until a certain point depending on the individual card. It’s important to note that you cannot play a development card on the same turn that you have bought it.\\nAll instructions are written on the cards. There are three types of development cards in Catan: knights, progress cards and victory point cards.\\nKnight cards in Catan are similar to the Longest Road card in that the first player to play three knights in front of them will receive a two-point bonus for having the Largest Army. But, just like the Longest Road, this card can be stolen by another player if their army is larger than yours. Knights also activate the robber when played, in which case you behave as if you had just rolled a 7.\\nProgress cards in Catan vary and what they do is laid out very clearly on each card. They usually give you resources or allow you to build without spending resources. Once played, the card is removed from the game.\\nVictory point cards in Catan are the juiciest of the development cards, as they speed up your road to victory and remain hidden until you have enough victory points to win the game on your turn. Victory point cards are the only development cards that can be played on the same turn they are purchased.\\nHow to win Catan: scoring and end of the game\\nThe aim of Catan is simple: the first player to 10 victory points on their turn wins.\\nMake sure to keep count of your victory points (and your opponents’!) throughout the game by keeping track of buildings and any Longest Road/Largest Army bonuses.\\n\", metadata={'source': '/content/catan-rules.txt'})]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":89}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\n","    chunk_size=500,\n","    chunk_overlap=0,\n","    length_function=len\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"8ZRhj7_RT_vo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718431135083,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":217,"user":{"displayName":"Ram","userId":"14307099072586734628"}}},"execution_count":90,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)\n","docs[0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lp-cmBi9UUKh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718431135083,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Ram","userId":"14307099072586734628"}},"outputId":"9ff5ec06-fb7e-427c-86c3-2a009bd6d299"},"execution_count":91,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Document(page_content=\"The Settlers of Catan - or as it’s now officially called, just Catan - is a modern classic when it comes to board games.
